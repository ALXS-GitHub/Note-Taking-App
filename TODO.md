# TODO

- [ ] The window sizing is not entirely windows like. It should be possible to resize the window to any size. When dragging the window, Windows should be able to snap it to the edges of the screen. When using `win+left` or `win+right` the window should snap to the left or right half of the screen.
- [ ] Do the resizable components later. For now, elements have a fixed size.
